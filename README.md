# NLP, off the record

An NLP community blog.

Built with Jekyll off of the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme
and its [starter template](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter).

Currently contains sample materials from the starter template:

- Sample posts.
- Sample top navigation.
- Sample author sidebar with social links.
- Sample footer links.
- Paginated home page.
- Archive pages for posts grouped by year, category, and tag.
- Sample about page.
- Sample 404 page.
- Site wide search.

Needs to be [configured](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/).
See issues for other stuff that needs to be done.

## Troubleshooting

If you have a question about using Jekyll, start a discussion on the [Jekyll Forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll). Other resources:

- [Setting up a Jekyll site with GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)
- [Configuring GitHub Metadata](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration) to work properly when developing locally and avoid `No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.` warnings.
